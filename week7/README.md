Project Setup : When you open your hand in front of the webcam within the square, a diamond will be appeared in your hand! ( Please allow to use your camera ! )

You need to install OpenCV 3.4 to realize this effect.

Project Challenge : At the beginning, Hao & Agnes wanted to create this experience by using processing, p5, pr node.js but it didn't work. So we decided to use Python and also we use OpenCV to draw the diamond shape. To use openCV, we need to install Homebrew and cmake. After this process, we finally could create this experience !
